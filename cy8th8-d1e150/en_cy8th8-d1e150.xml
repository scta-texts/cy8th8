          The second consideration: 
          that any prince in the world,
          pope, emperor, and king,
          since he is a man and thus a rational animal,
          no spiritual or temporal power or authority 
          can exempt or absolve a prince from the natural law 
          or dictate of right reason or of eternal law,
          as 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e120">
            Baldus says learnedly in l. si aquam 6. et 7 columna C. de servitutibus et aqua pluria

          Indeed not only is every prince 
          subject to the natural and eternal law,
          but also to the just laws 
          which he himself has established,
          as regards the directive force according 
          to the judgment of God and in the forum of conscience. 
          The reason for this is that 
          since the just laws which princes establish are just 
          <!-- TODO: trans triage -->
          insofar and consequently have the force of binding 
          insofar as they proceed from the eternal and natural 
          or divine law and from the reasonable will of God,
          as they are known to be regulated 
          and derived from the rules of all human acts,
          to each of which every prince is necessarily 
          subject and from neither is he released,
          it remains that any prince,
          even the pope,
          is subject to just laws posited by humans,
          even those which he himself has enacted,
          according to the judgment of God 
          (by whose laws, namely natural and eternal, no man is excluded),
          and wherever the reason or mind of the law persuades 
          what is just and right,
          he is bound to observe it 
          and not to act against it. 
          On this 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e168">

          Moreover the natural law in us 
          is a certain participation of the eternal law 
          which has implanted in men such a conception 
          by which they can be directed 
          to act fittingly in their proper actions. 
          But the eternal law,
          according to 
          <ref>Augustine in book 10 on free choice</ref> 
          is the highest reason which must always be obeyed,
          the notion of which is impressed upon us 
          insofar as all knowledge of truth is a certain 
          irradiation and participation of the eternal law,
          which is unchangeable truth.

          And in <ref>book 22 against Faustus the same saint</ref> 
          says the eternal law is the divine mind or will 
          commanding that the natural order be preserved 
          and forbidding it to be disturbed. 
          Whence no less properly is law called a precept or prohibition,
          the very knowledge of things to be done or not done,
          than the truth itself enunciating 
          what is to be done or not done. 
          Whence 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e218">
            Hugh of Saint Victor book 1

          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Qd1e204">
            What was the knowledge of things to be done 
            except a certain precept made to the heart of man?

          From which it is clear that law or constitution 
          does not consist in the whim of any legislator,
          but in right and regulated reason. 
          And therefore Gratian said: 
          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Qd1e221">
            Human law is whatever consists in reason
          </quote>

            1 dist., c. consuetudo
          </ref>. 
          And 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e232">
            Baldus in c. 1, de constitutionibus
          </ref> 
          says that 
          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Qd1e237">
            law consists in the substance of reason,
            is common to all men of the world;
            therefore law founded in the substance of natural reason 
            ought to be common to all men 
            wherever and whenever a case occurs 
            in which the reason of such a law appears
          </quote>. 
          From this it is that the reason of law 
          should always be attended to more than the law itself,
          that is the words of the law, 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e250">
            l. 1, c. quesit longa consuetudo

            l. cum muliere ff saluto matrimonio.
          </ref> 
          And the final reason is the soul of the law according to 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e274">
            Baldus in l. siquis seruo, C. de furtis
          </ref>. 
          Whence wherever the reason of the law has place,
          the law itself has place, 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e280">
            C. de interdictis. l. 1
          </ref>,
          even if the words contradict 
          according to the Archdeacon <!-- reference? --> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e284">

          The emperor confesses this quite openly:

            It is,
            he says,
            a voice worthy of the majesty of one reigning 
            that the prince professes himself bound by the laws,
            because the authority of the prince 
            depends on the authority of law,
            and truly it is greater than empire 
            to submit the principate to the laws,
            so that the prince may think nothing permitted to him 
            which departs from the equity of justice
          </quote>,

          It is clear therefore how the princes of the world,
          even the vicar of Christ,
          are subject to the reasons of their laws 
          and are bound to observe them,
          not because the laws say so,
          but because reason so wills. 
          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Qd1e301">
            Nevertheless princes are said 
            to be released from the bonds of law,
            not because iniquitous things are permitted to them,
            but because they ought to be those 
            who procure the equity of the republic 
            not by fear of punishment but by love of justice,
            and prefer the advantages of others 
            to their private will in all things
          </quote> 
          according to

          Moreover princes are said to be above the laws etc.,
          above the laws,
          especially the pope and emperor,
          insofar as they can change them for a reasonable and just cause,
          not however according to the whim of their will,
          and can in them for place and time whenever a reasonable 
          case occurs dispense with others and themselves reasonably,
          as in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e377">
            c. licet de constitutionibus lib. 6

          But coming against positive law 
          without legitimate cause 
          by not observing the law which the prince enacted,
          he sins with that kind of sin and sometimes more gravely 
          by reason of scandal by which others transgress them,
          as is read and noted in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e391">
            c. Que in ecclesiarum de constitutionibus

          Whence from this he cannot act 
          against his own agreements and pacts 
          which he contracts with a subject,

          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e398">

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-d1e346">
          For he ought to act as a good father of a family,
          since power has been given to him to feed the sheep,
          not to disturb or molest them. 
          And he ought to proceed 
          from the rectitude of justice and equity,
          not from special affection,

          Moreover this must always be presumed of a prince 
          unless the contrary expressly appears,
          especially of the most holy vicar of Christ. 
          For since a prince is the guardian of justice,
          he is not presumed to wish to take away anyone's right,

          and to regulate all his acts 
          not only by the justice of the forum 
          but also of the pole,

          but to defend them even to the soul and blood,

            It is to be known most especially 
            that the Roman Pontiff 
            can establish new laws

            and prophets said nothing. 
            But where the Lord himself or his apostles 
            and the holy fathers 
            following them have defined otherwise sententially,
            there the Roman Pontiff ought not to establish a new law 
            but rather should confirm 
            what has been preached even to the soul and blood. 
            For if he were to strive to destroy 
            what the apostles and prophets taught (which God forbid),
            he would be convicted not of giving a sentence 
            but rather of erring. 
            But let this be far from those

          The rectitude of intention therefore appears,
          and the love of preserving rectitude 
          and not harming divine justice especially 
          and natural justice to the prejudice of anyone,
          of the apostolic prince. 
          For he knows better that with divine justice as patron,
          the rights of others and those which pertain to each one 
          by natural and divine right ought to be fixed and immutable. 
          Because divine justice is necessary,

          The third consideration: 
          that the final cause of the aforesaid institution,
          concession or papal donation of our kings 
          to the imperium of that world 
          was not that the supreme pontiff intended 
          principally to elevate our kings of Spain 
          to a greater status 
          or to give them with ampler riches 
          or to make them wealthier,
          but the final cause was entirely the preaching of the gospel 
          and the expansion of the faith 
          or divine worship and Christian religion 
          and the conversion and salvation 
          of the inhabitants of that aforesaid world,
          and thus for their profit and favor. 
          Indeed the supreme pontiff intended this principally and finally,
          not any advantage of our kings or any temporal utility of theirs,
          except distantly and per accidens.

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-d1e579">
          It is proved first because no cause was or could be by right for the supreme pontiff to intrude himself concerning disposing of the temporalities of infidels,
          their internal affairs and proper kingdoms so remote and without prejudice to anyone of the universal church living,
          of whom knowledge to us or ours to them was never before heard,
          except for the cause of preaching the faith and opening the way of salvation to all those peoples.

          except from a great and arduous cause,
          for which applies the harsher 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e608">
            saying of

            the pope cannot by his rescript in any way and with cause 
            take away from any layman not temporally subject to him 
            the dominion of his property,
            because since this is a jurisdictional act, 
            as is noted in 
            <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Rd1e708">

          Thus from him. 
          See Felinus in

          </ref>,
          where he treats this matter at length. 
          But it is most true that with cause he can. 
          Therefore far less outside the church,
          that is concerning the temporal goods of infidels,
          because it is nothing to him 
          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Qd1e630">

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-d1e636">
          Second it is proved from the express words of the 
          Roman pontiff himself in the letters of concession or aforesaid institution,
          where he says thus: 
          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-Qd1e645">
            Desiring that the name itself of our savior 
            be brought into those parts,
            we exhort you as much as possible 
            in the Lord for the reception of the sacred bath 
            in which you are obliged by apostolic mandates,
            and we earnestly require 
            the bowels of mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,
            that since you intend with ready mind 
            with the zeal of orthodox faith 
            to altogether prosecute and undertake this expedition,
            you may wish and ought to induce the peoples 
            in such islands and lands living 
            there to receive the Christian religion
          </quote> 
          etc. 
          And often the supreme pontiff 
          shows this in the same apostolic letters,
          namely to concede superiority of that world 
          for the sake of preaching the faith 
          and conversion of its inhabitants as the final cause,
          certainly not about to concede anything else,
          as we most fully proved in our treatise "Comprobatio" 
          on royal law at the end of the proof of the first conclusion.

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e150-d1e678">
          Therefore, 
          not to elevate our kings to a higher status 
          or to render them wealthier principally,
          but principally and finally 
          for the sake of the amplification of faith 
          and divine worship and the conversion of those peoples,
          and thus for their profit and favor. 
          We also proved this at length
