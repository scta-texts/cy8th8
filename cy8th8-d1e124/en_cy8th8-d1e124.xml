        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e99">
          § 5
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e104">
          Since in the beginning of 
          the responsive conclusion  to the raised question 
          we excluded also our illustrious and most Christian king,
          namely that not even his highness 
          without the license and free consent of King Inca,
          and indeed a great king of the kingdoms of Peru,
          or of other kings 
          or petty kings to whom it pertains, 
          or their heirs,
          can send or order to inquire 
          or search and take treasures and other precious things 
          which are in tombs etc.,
          therefore we judge it worthy 
          to render an account of such matters.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e135">
          And it is proved thus: 
          That King Inca and his successors 
          are princes and supreme and universal lords of all the kingdoms of Peru,
          not recognizing a superior,
          and they have just pure and mixed imperium a
          nd all manner of power and jurisdiction,
          just as other free kings of the world.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e148">
          Therefore no king or prince in the world can 
          without his or their license and good pleasure 
          enter those kingdoms and seek or search for 
          what is in them and take them.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e158">
          The antecedent is clear: 
          because that whole world,
          of which those kingdoms of Peru are part,
          is most remote in the highest ocean sea 
          from every other region of all those 
          which men have ever known,
          which we found occupied and possessed 
          by those Indians living there 
          and proper kings reigning over them, 
          <!-- TODO: trans triage -->
          and thus exempt from every superior or free. 
          And these things are sufficiently proved by 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Rd1e174">
            l. ex hoc iure
          </ref> 
          with the note there by the doctors: 
          by this law the peoples were distinguished,
          kingdoms founded by individual peoples 
          who elected kings for themselves according to 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Rd1e183">
            the gloss "dominia distincta"
          </ref> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Rd1e188">
            gratia ff de iustitia et iure
          </ref>,
          where it appears that by natural and law of nations 
          those peoples and their kings are lords and free,
          recognizing no one as superior,
          neither by right nor in fact,
          before we recognized them.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e189">
          Moreover that one is called a superior 
          to whom the place pertains from the nature of the place,
          that is by outcome:
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Rd1e204">

          But better in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Rd1e209">
            consilio 328 primae par. ultima questio
          </ref>,
          where he says: 
          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Qd1e198">
            it makes no difference 
            whether someone is called king or duke,
            because force is not to be applied to the name 
            but to the quality of rule 
            and the magnitude of power,
            <ref>argumentum ff. de conditionibus et demonstrationibus l. pater severinam § conditionum</ref>
          </quote>; 
          thus Baldus,
          and far better still 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Rd1e225">
            the same 2e par. for our proposition
          </ref> 
          says thus: 
          <quote xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Qd1e213">
            that by the law of nations 
            kings hold the supreme position 
            even among infidels 
            and therefore appeal is not made from them;
            it also appears that with kings 
            there is that species of lordship 
            which is called universal,
            but the particular pertains to individuals per se,
            but to the king per accidens,
            that is through an accidental cause,
            for example on account of a crime,
            and therefore

          Indeed the consequence is proved

          and especially with an army 
          against the will or tacit or express prohibition of the proper king,
          he is said to disturb him by simple entry,
          whence he commits injury to him,
          and by taking anything from there,
          especially something precious,
          he usurps what is another's,

          Whence any king or universal moderator of any kingdom 
          not recognizing a superior,
          if he sees it expedient for peace and quiet,
          for avoiding bad morals,
          for the defense,
          security and conservation of the kingdom 
          or his republic in liberty,
          can establish or by royal law prohibit 
          that no one of foreigners or aliens 
          or any person of another kingdom 
          may enter the kingdom or province or city of his jurisdiction,
          either for the sake of trade,

          or for the sake of dwelling or inhabiting,
          or for any other reason.

          since it pertains to royal circumspection and care 
          to provide for future dangers of the kingdom or republic,
          so that it may be rendered safe against external enemies. 
          Since not only is what is present attended to,
          but also what can be,

          Indeed by these things 
          which we have just touched upon and explained 
          with brief delay,
          and in our work on the only way of calling 
          all peoples to the true religion 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-Rd1e453">
            book 1, chapter 3
          </ref>,
          which were elucidated with the widest discourse,
          we think that no one exists 
          who would not freely assent 
          unless he suffers either some defect of mind 
          or inexperience of Catholic doctrine.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e392">
          To these things,
          however,
          only the papal institution seems to stand in the way,
          made concerning our kings of Spain as superiors 
          over the kings and moderators of that whole Indian world,
          by virtue and authority of which,
          since all peoples and inhabitants of those lands 
          remain subjects of our kings by reason of the faith to be preached,
          therefore all other things 
          which follow persons seem to be subject to them,
          and consequently they can decree or determine 
          about all things which are in the kingdoms,
          and thus about the aforesaid treasures and whatever is precious,
          at pleasure or by arbitration as supreme princes.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e414">
          Whence although all things determined in the preceding 
          are true as regards any other kings of the world,
          nevertheless not as regards the kings of Spain,
          who by peculiar privilege and donation 
          through the apostolic see 
          were elevated to imperial height over that world.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e428">
          To which we say that it is indeed true that 
          the Catholic kings of Castile and Leon 
          were constituted by the providence and gracious donation of the apostolic see 
          as supreme princes over that world by reason of the care 
          which the same holy see enjoined upon them 
          for preaching the faith and converting the inhabitants of it,
          as appears in the apostolic letters of the aforesaid institution or donation.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e124-d1e446">
          But truly not by the law itself or by the very fact 
          that such our kings were named or instituted by the supreme pontiff 
          was the dominion of that entire world transferred to them,
          nor possession, according to what is noted by the legists in
