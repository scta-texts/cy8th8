          Corollary Four.
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> Our Catholic kings could not establish Spanish barons, 
          dukes, 
          or marquises by submitting to them cities or making them feudatories or in any other mode of subjection:
          and whatever provisions of this kind were made before now were null and invalid.
          However,
          they were certainly able to honor whichever Spaniards they wished with bare titles alone:
          because through bare titles no harm seems to be done to the indigenous peoples nor to their kings.
        </p>

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-d1e144">
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> The corollary is proved by the reasons adduced to prove both parts of the preceding corollary.
          And certain other reasons are added.
          First because our kings do not yet have those kingdoms and peoples actually in their power;
          therefore they cannot give them to Spaniards;
          because no one gives or can give what he does not have.
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e158">l. si filius C. de donabus</ref>:
          according to 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e162">Bartholus in l. obseruare</ref>, 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e164">Baldus ff. de officio proconsulis</ref>
          or no one can transfer more right to another than he himself has
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e174">ff. de regulis iuris l. nemo</ref> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e176">ff. de acquirendo rerum dominio l. traditio</ref>, 
          and
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e179">de dote post diuortium C. nuper</ref>.
          And what is given by one who cannot lawfully give is held as not given.
          as in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e187">c. quod autem de iure patronatus.</ref> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e192">C. qui pro sua iurisdictione l. vna.</ref> 
          The objection based on 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e194">d. l. obseruare.</ref> 
          does not stand,
          where the proconsul before entering the province commits cases by virtue of the jurisdiction 
          that he has in potentiality to a subject existing in that same province,
          which is an act of voluntary jurisdiction:
          both because our kings do not have jurisdiction fully purified in potentiality 
          and therefore cannot use voluntary jurisdiction as in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e212">§ 30</ref> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e214">29</ref> 
          and has often been said.
          Also because they have neither territory nor subject in that entire world as we suppose and has been demonstrated above.
        </p>

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-d1e201">
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> Second,
          the corollary is proved because our kings committed the greatest injustice and injury 
          and most enormous harm to the kings and princes of those peoples:
          despoiling them of their states and dignities,
          jurisdictions and their men or subject peoples:
          and subjecting them to certain chief Spanish tyrants of humble condition,
          indeed to base men,
          and thus to their dominion:
          men whom,
          on account of their crimes committed against those most innocent peoples,
          under the appearance of fortitude and great and most distinguished deeds offered to them,
          they elevated to the dignity of marquises or prelates:
          when rather and more worthily they deserved to appear in the forum by order of our kings,
          cut to pieces in public,
          to which our kings were also bound by necessity of salvation to command.
        </p>

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-d1e248">
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> Third because our kings condemned those common people also to the worst servitude,
          when they were free,
          contrary to natural reason,
          by giving them to the aforementioned marquises and prelates.
        </p>

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-d1e260">
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> Fourth because according to Bartholus,
          to one who has violently occupied a city or province,
          if the prince grants the city or province violently occupied:
          the concession or confirmation is not valid as in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e275">l. meminerim C. Unde vi.</ref> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e280">ibi Bartholus</ref> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e282">Baldus in l. decernimus C. de sacrosanctis ecclesiis</ref> 
          he also confirms the same saying:
          that to those invading fortresses belonging to just lords,
          those fortresses cannot be granted by the prince:
          whether the invaders are private persons or individuals:
          or whether they are communities as in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e318">l. 2 C. de fundis</ref> 
          and 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e320">saltibus lib. 11o</ref>
          where this is noted.
          These are Baldus's words.
          Behold how clearly all impugn this tyranny.
          For it is manifest that those fortresses,
          those cities,
          those provinces and other places pertain to just lords,
          and yet were invaded and most unjustly occupied by those violent tyrants;
          therefore our kings could not grant them to the same men nor to others,
          nor was the concession made of any validity.
        </p>

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-d1e311">
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> Fifth because if Saul and David elected and anointed by God as kings 
          did not dare during all that time in which they held the principate of that kingdom in potentiality 
          (because they certainly knew it to be God's will) 
          to assume for themselves anything of royal power in actuality:
          nor to commit or give anything to another:
          without doubt our kings elected and instituted by the supreme vicar of Christ:
          neither for themselves nor for another should they have,
          nor were they able (except as decided above) 
          to occupy themselves with this kind of exercise in actuality.
          But certainly the many errors that occurred throughout this Indian affair should not be imputed to the royal persons:
          but to the royal senate which was bound to scrutinize this most important and most dangerous matter,
          which is not allowed to be ignorant of the law:
          Therefore ignorance did not excuse them and will not excuse them.
          For they are equivalent as regards the guilt of fault and punishment,
          to know or to be bound to know.
        </p>

          <del rend="strikethrough">in C. si culpa de in iur</del> 
          Fifth Corollary
        </p>

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-d1e369">
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> Our kings could not send governors or viceroys or magistrates,
          nor courts (or as they are commonly called audiencias reales) 
          or other judges or ministers to administer justice.
          Whence those whom they have sent up to now had usurped jurisdiction,
          and whatever was judged or done by them was not valid by law.
        </p>

        <p xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-d1e387">
          <pc type="pilcrow">¶</pc> The corollary is proved as to the first part by the reasons adduced 
          to prove the preceding corollary,
          especially by the first,
          and more extensively by the corollary of the third conclusion and its proof in § 29 and 30,
          namely because our kings have no jurisdiction in actuality but only in potentiality,
          not fully at present but to be purified from future acts,
          namely by the consent and voluntary acceptance of the kings and peoples of that world;
          and therefore they cannot even commit what they have in potentiality to be exercised 
          within the territories and districts of the Indians,
          because they have neither territory nor subjects as has been proved many times:
          although they could have committed the potentiality of jurisdiction if they had a fully pure potentiality,
          being outside the territory,
          to a subject existing in the same territory,
          but not the exercise of a jurisdictional act,
          because they themselves were not able to exercise it;
          therefore our kings could not and cannot send or appoint viceroys,
          governors,
          presidents,
          judges,
          magistrates or royal audiencias etc.
          The consequence is evident by 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e460">l. obseruare in fin. ff. de officio proconsulis et legati</ref> 
          where it is said
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e435">
            For it is extremely absurd:
            before they themselves acquire jurisdiction,
            to delegate it to others.
          </ref>
          And it is proved more properly and strictly by 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e471">
            capitulum Romana de appellationibus lib. 6 where by that text in § cum autem
          </ref>.
          It is evident that an archbishop who had jurisdiction not fully in potentiality 
          could not depute an official in the diocese of his suffragan concerning appeals to be interposed to him.
          Because jurisdiction even in potentiality did not yet pertain to him before the appeal was interposed,
          which was the act that was lacking so that he would have jurisdiction in potentiality fully purified at present.
          Therefore such judges or viceroys etc.
          Therefore such viceroys,
          presidents,
          governors,
          royal audiencias etc.
          had and now have usurped jurisdiction,
          which is the second part of the corollary.
          Which is proved because they were deputed or appointed by one not having jurisdiction or power:
          and in injury or offense of the natural kings and lords in whose bones the jurisdiction of that world is implanted.
          For whoever in another's kingdom or province against the will of the prince or magistrate of that place 
          should presume to exercise jurisdiction:
          is an invader of another's right and does injury to the king or prince of such kingdom,
          despising his majesty:
          and consequently can be opposed even with armed force unto extermination,
          and can be resisted as an enemy of a foreign kingdom,
          a violator and invader,
          usurper and tyrant,
          by the argument of 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e505" target="http://scta.info/resource/azsw2e-d1e70-Dd1e308">

          For every province and kingdom of the world naturally desires its own jurisdiction,
          by which communities of men protect themselves in their formal political being.
          And jurisdiction desires its own and proper territory:

          ruler or judge,
          spiritual or temporal or secular,
          persons are private,
          not public (that is) 
          having no exercise of jurisdiction,
          just as if they were dead as in

          that

            outside territory anyone exceeding the boundary of his jurisdiction is not obeyed with impunity:

          But that nothing is valid by law,
          whatever was done or judged by them was or in the future may be done:
          not only as to those things that concern the inhabitants (about which no one will doubt 
          unless devoid of natural light) 
          but also judgments or sentences pronounced by them between Spaniards,
          and all things whatsoever they have done:
          will without doubt be null,
          as is evidently proved by

          nor are they confirmed by any length of time,

          And the common reason is:
          because without the permission and good pleasure of the kings and magistrates of that world:
          they could not and cannot declare law even among Spaniards subject to our kings without injury:
          since they are in foreign territory and thus private persons.
          Unless those jurisdictional acts were ordained for the defense of the Indians 
          and for administering justice for them concerning injuries and grievances received from the Spaniards.
          For then such acts will be valid:
          because we should reasonably believe that the kings and magistrates of the Indians 
          would willingly grant all their jurisdiction and authority to effect such acts in their favor:
          the argument is found in 
          <ref xml:id="cy8th8-d1e571-Rd1e822">presidentis de sententia excomunicationis lib. 6</ref>
